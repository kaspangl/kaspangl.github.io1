<font color = "A7C7E7" size ="5">Bradley and Kammie Z used our catering services for their wedding last summer. They wanted options to serve all their guests and not have to worry about it. Kammie later told us: "It was awesome to not have to worry about the section of what I could and could not eat. Everything was allergy-friendly." <a href = "Banner.pdf" Click here to see all our allergy accommodation offerings! </a> <\font>
